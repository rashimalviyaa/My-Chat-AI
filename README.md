# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Chat AI Application:
This project is a full-featured chat AI application developed using a modern tech stack, including Node.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS, JSX, HTML, CSS, the Gemini API, Vite, and Axios. It offers a responsive and interactive user experience for generating AI-driven responses.

Technologies Used:
1)Node.js: Backend server environment.
2)React.js: Frontend framework for building user interfaces.
3)Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
4)JSX: JavaScript XML used in React.
5)HTML & CSS: Markup and styling languages.
6)Gemini API: For generating AI responses.
7)Vite: Frontend build tool for faster development.
8)Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for API requests.

How It Works:
1)User Input: Users enter their questions into a text area.
2)API Request: Upon submission (or pressing Enter), the application sends a POST request to the Gemini API using Axios, passing the user's question.
3)Loading State: While waiting for a response, a loading spinner is displayed to indicate that the answer is being generated.
4)Response Handling: Once the API responds, the answer is displayed below the input area. If an error occurs, an error message is shown.

Key Features:
1)Interactive UI: User-friendly interface with real-time interaction.
2)Loading Spinner: Visual indication while waiting for the AI response.
3)Error Handling: Graceful error messages for failed API requests.
4)Responsive Design: Ensures a seamless experience across all devices using Tailwind CSS.
5)Optimized Development: Vite ensures fast development and efficient builds.
6)Easy Integration: Simplified API requests with Axios.

Usage:
1)Enter your question in the text area and press Enter or click the "Generate Answer" button.
2)Wait for the AI to generate the response, which will be displayed below the input area.
